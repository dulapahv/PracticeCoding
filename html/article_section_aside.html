			Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content
			that can be used and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site.
			This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment,
			an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.

			<section> is a logical container of the page or article.
			Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
			For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company,
			another for news items, and still another for contact information.

			Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading
			(h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element.

			<aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate
			from but indirectly related to the main content.
			This type of content is often represented in sidebars.
			When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside>
			should be specifically related to that article.
