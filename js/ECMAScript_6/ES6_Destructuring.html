			/*
			The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that
			makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from
			objects, into distinct variables.
			ES6 has added a shorthand syntax for destructuring an array.

			The following example demonstrates how to unpack the elements of an
			array into distinct variables:
			*/
			let arr = ['1', '2', '3'];
			let [one, two, three] = arr;
			document.writeln(`${one} ${two} ${three}`);

			/*
			We can use also destructure an array returned by a function.
			*/
			let a = () => {
				return [1, 2, 3];
			};
			let [one2, , two2] = a();
			document.writeln(`<br>${one2} ${two2}`);

			/* swapping values */
			let x = 2, y = 3;
			[x, y] = [y, x];
			document.writeln(`<br>${x}, ${y}`)
