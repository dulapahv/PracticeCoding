			JavaScript variables can be Object data types that contain many
			values called properties.
			An object can also have properties that are function definitions
			called methods for performing actions on the object.
			ES6 introduces shorthand notations and computed property names that
			make declaring and using objects easier to understand.

			The new method definition shorthand does not require the colon (:)
			or function keyword, as in the grow function of the tree object
			declaration:
			*/
			let tree = {
				height: 10,
				color: "green",
				grow() {
					this.height += 2;
				},
			};
			tree.grow();
			document.writeln(tree.height);

			/*
			You can also use a property value shorthand when initializing
			properties with a variable by the same name.
			For example, properties height and health are being initialized with
			variables named height and health
			*/
			let height = 5;
			let health = 100;

			let athlete = {
				height,
				health,
			};

			/*
			With ES6, you can now use computed property names. Using the square
			bracket notation [], we can use an expression for a property name,
			including concatenating strings. This can be useful in cases where
			we want to create certain objects based on user data (e.g. id,
			email, and so on).
			*/
			let prop = "name";
			let id = "1234";
			let mobile = "08923";

			let user = {
				[prop]: "Jack",
				[`user_$[id]`]: `$[mobile]`,
			};
			document.writeln(user.name);
			document.writeln(user.user_1234);

			/*
			ES6 adds a new Object method assign() that allows us to combine
			multiple sources into one target to create a single new object.
			Object.assign() is also useful for creating a duplicate of an
			existing object.
			*/
			let person = {
				name: "Nuko",
				age: 20,
			};

			let newPerson = Object.assign({}, person);
			newPerson.name = "Nao";

			document.writeln(person.name);
			document.writeln(newPerson.name);
